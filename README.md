## Usage

**CAUTION**: Due to the nature of the implementation, this code might execute dangerous commands generated by AI on your computer. Run it with caution and in a sandbox environment if possible. Also this only works on Windows now, but can easily be adapted to linux and other OS by modifying the prompt and `execute_command()` function.

The library uses `requests`, so make sure it's installed using `pip install requests`.

To run the program, set environment variable using `$env:openai_api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>`. Then run the program with

```
python cli.py
```

## Examples

### Some examples that do exist in the prompt

```
Enter your instruction: What is the time now?
thought: To know the current time, I need to call `Get-Date`.
command: Get-Date

Executing command...
result: Monday, April 3, 2023 8:28:12 PM

answer: The current time is 8:28:12 PM on Monday, April 3, 2023.


Enter your instruction: Where am I?
thought: To know your location, I need to get your IP address and location using an external API.
command: (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://ipinfo.io/json" -UseBasicParsing).Content

Executing command...
result: {
  "ip": "49.65.213.24",
  "city": "Nanjing",
  "region": "Jiangsu",
  "country": "CN",
  "loc": "32.0617,118.7778",
  "org": "AS4134 CHINANET-BACKBONE",
  "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}

answer: You are currently in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.


Enter your instruction: What is the weather in Nanjing?
thought: To know the current weather, I will call an external API to retrieve the current weather data for Nanjing.
command: (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://wttr.in/NanJing?format=`"%C+%t %P`"").Content

Executing command...
result: "Rain shower +15°C 1007hPa"

answer: The weather is currently a rain shower and the temperature is 15°C (59°F) in Nanjing. The air pressure is 1007hPa. Make sure to carry an umbrella if you are planning to go outside. It might be a good time to watch a movie or read a book indoors. Stay dry and stay safe!
```

### A more complex one that does not exist in the prompt

```
Enter your instruction: How is my computer status?
thought: To check your computer's status, I can use `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to obtain various information such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.
command: Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem,Win32_Processor,Win32_LogicalDisk | Format-Table -AutoSize

Executing command...
error: Error executing script: #< CLIXML
<Objs Version="1.1.0.1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04"><S S="Error">Get-CimInstance : Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String' required by parameter 'ClassName'.

thought: It looks like there is an error in the command. I need to run `Get-CimInstance -ClassName` with each class separately to retrieve information on CPU, memory, and disk usage.
command: Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem | Format-Table CSName, Caption, LastBootUpTime, TotalVisibleMemorySize, FreePhysicalMemory, OperatingSystemSKU -AutoSize       

Executing command...

answer: Based on the results of `Get-CimInstance` cmdlets, your computer seems to be running Windows 11 Professional edition, has an Intel Core i7-13700KF CPU, and 16 cores with the maximum clock speed of 3400 MHz. The computer has 32,405,728 KB of visible memory and there is currently 16,514,420 KB of free physical memory available. The computer has four disks: C, D, E and F. The storage size and available free space are shown for each disk. Is there anything specific you would like me to check?
